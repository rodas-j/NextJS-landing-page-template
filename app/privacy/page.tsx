              information relevant to the requested service with those third
              parties. We use third-party large language models (LLMs) to
              support some of our functionality. Depending on the functionality
              you select, your Personal Information may be shared with
              third-party tools, including LLMs. For example, if you instruct
              the Services to research a topic using a particular third-party
              service, the search terms will be shared with the selected
              third-party service. Please see the “Third-Party Services” section
              below. Your information also may be shared with third parties if
              you use the Services to schedule a meeting, which will require us
              to disclose Personal Information relevant to the scheduling to
              other attendees in accordance with your instructions.

          Email Digest processes the content of the email thread you open while
          using the add-on. This data is then transmitted to third-party
          services such as OpenAI or Microsoft Azure to generate summaries and
          to extract actionable items for an email thread. Email Digest provides
          greater privacy compared to directly using Chat GPT. This is due to
          the fact that the prompts you enter in Chat GPT are utilized by OpenAi
          to train the language model. On the other hand, Email Digest employs
          the API version of Chat GPT, which adheres to stricter data privacy
          regulations. Please note that all data transmitted to Chat GPT's
          completion API endpoint is protected using the Transport Layer
          Security protocol while in transit. Additionally, any data sent to
          Chat GPT's completion API endpoint is kept private and used solely by
          OpenAI to monitor potential misuse. This data is not for developing,
          improving, or training generalized/ non-personalized AI/ML models.
          Furthermore, all transmitted information is automatically deleted
          after 30 days for added protection. For more information, please refer
          to{" "}

          This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for,

          imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our

          In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection,
          use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other
          organizations, such as Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft,
          RIM, or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform
          provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or

          You may opt out from receiving marketing-related emails from us. If
          you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us on a

          which you cannot opt out.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>7. Storage and Security</strong>{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          You use the Service at your own risk. We implement commercially
          reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to
          protect Personal Data both online and offline from loss, misuse, and
          unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Our
          systems and policies have undergone a Google Security Review. This
          security audit verifies that we are capable of handling data securely
          and deleting user data upon user request.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or
          error free. In particular, email sent to or from us may not be secure.
          Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information
          you send to us via the Service or email. Please keep this in mind when
          disclosing any Personal Data to Shortwave via the Internet. In
          addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy
          settings or security measures contained on the Service, or third party
          websites.

        <p>
          Our Service is not directed to children who are under the age of 13.
          Shortwave does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under
          the age of 13. If you have reason to believe that a child under the
          age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Shortwave through the Service
          please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that information from
          our databases.

          The Services may provide functionality allowing you to make payments

          responsible for, any such third party’s collection, use, or disclosure
          of your Personal Information.
